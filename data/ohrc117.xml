      <abstract audience="internal" id="aspace_0575cb92949f9e3fa0eec177c7637901" label="Scope and Content Note">This project centers around interviews with professional and/or personal acquaintances of Elinor and Vincent Ostrom. Every interview explores a unique relationship with the Ostroms and the continuing impact of the Ostrom Workshop at Indiana University. Elinor (Lin) and Vincent Ostrom founded the Workshop in Political Theory and Policy Analysis in 1973.The Ostrom Workshop has been the catalyst for worldwide collaboration in the field of public policy and environmental issues. "Coming Together" is an interdisciplinary exploration of the legacy and impact of Elinor (Lin) and Vincent Ostrom. Major topics include; academia, "the commons", cross-disciplinary collaboration, Elinor Ostrom's Nobel Prize, the Ostrom Workshop, political science, political theory, and the Workshop on the Ostrom Workshop (WOW) conference. The project was created to assist in the dissertation research of Sara Catherine Clark, who was a doctoral candidate within the School of Education, pursing a Ph.D. in History, Philosophy, and Policy in Education, at Indiana University Bloomington. Sara Catherine Clark's dissertation was completed in 2019 and is cited as follows: Clark, S. C. (2019).

          <p>Dr. Paul Dragos Aligica is a professor in the Economics Department in Politics and Economics at Mercatus Center at George Mason University. Dragos Aligica first met Elinor and Vincent Ostrom at the Workshop but was familiar with their work before arriving there. He discusses the way academic institutions work and the way the Ostroms didn't conform to those rules. Later he discusses collaborating with the Ostroms through the Ostrom Workshop. Dragos Aligica also recalls Elinor Ostrom as a teacher and her humor. He goes on to discuss how the Ostroms intellectual lineage will be looked at in the future. The interview concludes with talk about the Workshop on the Ostrom Workshop (WOW) Conference and a more in-depth talk about the Ostrom Workshop.</p>

          <p>Anonymous begins the interview by explaining their connection to Elinor Ostrom as a student in the political science department. This leads to discussion of Ostrom as a teacher, working with her on the Health Commons Research Project, and experiences with her at the Ostrom Workshop. They speak of the Occupy Movement as an important part of their academic career and the connection to Ostrom's work. Anonymous goes on to discuss how they would tell the Ostroms' story which includes discussion of the Nobel Prize in Economics. Then Anonymous is asked to discuss lingering research questions, those questions deal with power and the colonial experience within the commons. The interview closes discussing the Ostrom Workshop and Elinor Ostrom's work on language.</p>

          <p>Eduardo Brondizio is a professor of Anthropology at Indiana University. He met Elinor Ostrom while developing a proposal for a Center of excellence on the study of population, institutions, and environmental change (CIPEC). He discusses the way the Ostroms built teams by creating a space where common language was upheld above discipline specific language and the overarching idea of research around problems, not disciplines. He goes on to describe how he began working at the Ostrom Workshop and what he does there now. Personal and last memories of Elinor Ostrom are also shared.</p>

Evans was hired by Elinor Ostrom and Emilio Moran in 1998 as a post-doctoral scholar at the Center for the Study of Institutions, Population, and Environmental Change (CIPEC). During his post-doc he was a co-principle investigator with Elinor Ostrom, working on a biocomplexity Nation Science Foundation grant. Later, Evans became co-director of CIPEC and co-director of the Ostrom Workshop which he discusses at length. He also discusses some of the core research that was going on at the Ostrom Workshop such as the social-ecological system (SES) framework. Evans closes the interview by discussing the Workshop on the Ostrom Workshop Conference and the 2009 Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences.</p>

          <p>Burnell Fischer is the Clinical Professor Emeritus in the School of Public and Environmental Affairs. Fischer discusses his time as the State Forester of Indiana. Fischer wanted more collaboration with a greater variety of stakeholders and he discusses how he made that work. While he was working at the State Forester of Indiana Elinor Ostrom contacted him to come down and speak to her and her graduate students. During this time a collaborative was formed between Indiana University, Purdue University, The Nature Conservancy, and Professor Dan Cole of IUPUI (now Indiana University Bloomington). Fischer then began working at Indiana University where he assisted Elinor Ostrom in teaching. His position moved from work at the Ostrom Workshop to his position as the undergraduate program director at the School of Public and Environmental Affairs. Fischer recalls his time at the Nobel ceremony and why he was there. The interview concludes discussing the Workshop on the Ostrom Workshop (WOW) and the Ostrom Workshops future.</p>

He is also connected to the Vincent Ostrom through a family connection on his wife's side, Joan Hart. He goes onto discuss the way Elinor Ostrom interacted with her graduate students and the influence she had. Hart discusses more of his own research on international political economy and the way that did or did not intertwine with the Ostrom Workshop. This discussion eventually leads to conversation of the future of political science.

          <p>Joan Hart is an art historian and textile specialist. Hart first met Vincent and Elinor Ostrom in Bloomington through political science department parties. Soon after meeting Vincent Ostrom, recognized a connection to Hart through Hart's uncle while they were both at the University of Oregon. Throughout the interview there is discussion of the Ostroms' hobbies such as collecting Native American artifacts like baskets, some of these baskets went on exhibit at the Mathers Museum. Hart goes into detail about the Ostroms' hobby of woodworking, how they were taught, their architectural influence and the pieces the Ostroms' had built which were used throughout the house. This leads to a discussion about the functions of the Ostrom house and the parties they liked to host. Further on Hart describes her time on the schoolboard, how Elinor Ostrom was helpful throughout her campaign. This leads to a discussion about Elinor's recognition for the Nobel Prize and the disparities between men and women in the academic setting. The interview concludes with Hart discussing many examples of Elinor Ostrom's generosity.</p>

Charlotte Hess was the Director of the Library and Information at the Ostrom Workshop from 1989 to 2008. Hess begins by recounting the way the library started and the way it developed, including what it was like to create the library catalog for the Workshop. Hess also talks about connecting the Ostroms' work and the International Association of Common Property. Later, she discusses editing Vincent Ostrom's book
            <i>The Meaning of Democracy and the Vulnerability of Democracies: A Response to Tocqueville's Challenge</i>
(1997) and Vincent Ostrom himself.

          <p>Leticia Merino is a researcher with a Doctorate of Anthropology specializing in agrarian studies. Merino opens the interview by discussing her personal background and how her background in forestry led her to Elinor Ostrom's book
            <i> Governing the Commons </i>. Merino met Ostrom in Mexico through Gustavo Gordillo, a mutual colleague. Merino was asked to go through the International Forestry Resources and Institutions (IFRI) program at the Ostrom Workshop, which she did, and became more involved after taking the course. Merino goes onto discuss collaborating with Ostrom through IFRI and the International Association for the Study of the Commons (IASC). She reflects on her friendship with Ostrom through a discussion of Ostrom's visit to a climate change conference in Mexico. The interview closes with a discussion on the 2012 Planet Under Pressure Conference in London where Ostrom was a keynote speaker.

          <p>Carol Parks is the spouse of Roger Parks and friend of the Ostroms'. Roger Parks is a former student of Elinor Ostrom's, which is how they initially met. Carol Parks built a stronger relationship with Elinor Ostrom while cataloging the artwork in the Ostrom house. During this cataloging project Elinor Ostrom and Parks consulted many different people and agencies including the Mathers Museum. This leads to a discussion about the construction of the Ostrom house, which was built like a Native American longhouse. She further discusses the Ostroms' collection of Native American work while they were at their Manitoulin Island house in Ontario, Canada. Roger and Carol Parks had the opportunity to go to this house on the island which is discussed. Parks then discusses the impact of Elinor Ostrom's Nobel Prize in Economics and the changes in the Ostrom Workshop over the years. The interview concludes with personal antecedents about the Ostroms.</p>

          <p>Catherine Tucker has a joint appointment with the Department of Anthropology and the Center for Latin American Studies at the University of Florida. Tucker begins her interview by recounting how she met Elinor Ostrom and her experiences with her at the Center for the Study of Institutions, Population, and Environmental Change (CIPEC). She goes on to discuss Ostrom as a mentor and her own teaching. Tucker then talks about her work at the Ostrom Workshop which includes her teaching with the International Forestry Research and Institutions Research Program (IFRI). The interview concludes with Tucker reflecting on Elinor Ostrom and Vincent Ostrom and how they, especially Elinor Ostrom, would want to be remembered.</p>

          <p>James Walker is a Professor of Economics at Indiana University. Walker first worked with Elinor Ostrom on a National Science Foundation proposal with Roy Gardner which is discussed in detail. After years of collaboration with the Ostroms, Walker became closer to them which led to him going with Elinor Ostrom to the Nobel Prize ceremony and he became executor of their estate. Walker also discusses the history of the Ostrom Workshop and the way it evolved over the years.</p>
